## Hi there 👋

I'm Dhanusree — a curious mind learning Java and solving DSA problems on LeetCode!  
Big fan of good coffee, great books, and emotional Korean dramas ☕📖📺  
Also... sleeping is basically my favorite sport 😴


- 🌱 I’m currently learning: Java, DSA, and a bit of frontend development 
- 💻 Most active on: LeetCode & GitHub  
- 📺 Favorite hobby: Watching K-dramas (and crying over them)  
- ☕ Always down for a cup of coffee  
- ⚡ Fun fact: My brain runs 10% Java and 90% sleep mode
