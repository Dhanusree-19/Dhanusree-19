## Hi there 👋

I'm Dhanusree — a curious mind learning Java and solving DSA problems on LeetCode!  
Big fan of good coffee, great books, and emotional Korean dramas ☕📖📺  
Also... sleeping is basically my favorite sport 😴

- 🌱 I’m currently learning: Java, DSA, and a bit of web development  
- 💻 Most active on: LeetCode & GitHub  
- 📺 Favorite hobby: Watching K-dramas (and crying over them)  
- ☕ Always down for a cup of coffee  
- ⚡ Fun fact:Sleep is my default state — unless I’m coding or watching something dramatic  

> **"Try until the you fly"** 🕊️✨
